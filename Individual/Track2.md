Team recommendation chosen
Early-Life Contract Conversion Campaign (encourage new customers to switch from month-to-month to annual plans within the first 60 days, with discounts/bundles and behavior-triggered outreach). 

What would be implemented?
Launch an email/Text massages offer targeting new month-to-month customers in their first 60 days, providing a limited-time discount to convert to a 12-month plan, plus optional bundles like tech support and security.

Success metric + baseline churn (and one metric we wouldn’t want to worsen)
Primary success metric:
Narrowed down that the most succeptible to churn is month to month customers 
Baseline to anchor on from our data- month-to-month customers have the highest churn rate at 42%.
Metric to make sure doesn't get worse is net revenue. we need to make sure thsi doesnt go down because of discounts

How would you measure impact
Impact measurement approach-
Run an A/B test on eligible new month-to-month customers:
Measure outcomes over a fixed window  for example churn within 60–90 days and compare churn rates, conversion to annual rate, and guardrails.

Two risks / unintended consequences (and mitigations):

Margin erosion / discount dependency
Risk - customers learn to wait for discounts and revenue drops without retention gains.
Mitigation: cap discount depth, use targeted eligibility (high-risk scores), and prefer value-add bundles (support/security) over pure price cuts. 

Customer backlash or higher support load

Risk - aggressive outreach increases complaints or support tickets; customers feel pressured.
Mitigation: frequency limits, preference-based channel controls, and monitoring support-contact rate as a guardrail; keep messaging helpful and opt-out friendly.
